# LaserKeyBox
Contains all the information for my laser key box. Its a simple lock box that holds a key. Made using what I had around: a Raspberry pi 1, Arduino Uno R3, Servo Motor, Limit Switch, LEDs, Active Buzzer, Magnets, Card Reader, RFID reader, and PLA.

# Raspberry Pi
I had to install the evdev library for this, and you'll have to change your text file name and log file name. Note that I set up the start script and logging using crontab on the pi.
